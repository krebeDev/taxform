# Tax Resource Form

The form enables users to create and edit tax resources. I didn't get to use the optional rest-hoook package however.

I've made an assumption on the rate field. The minimum and maximum allowable rates are "one" and "ninety nine" respectively.

Here's a [demo](http://krebeDev.github.io/taxform).

## Dependencies

- [React v17.0.2](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Formik v2.2.9](https://formik.org/)
- [React Testing Library v11.2.7](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

## Setup

Clone the respository and run the following commands in the project root directory:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start

```

I've created some unit tests. Run `npm test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
Visit [this page](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information about running tests.
